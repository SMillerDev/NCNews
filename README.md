# NCNews
An iOS client for [Nextcloud news](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/news "news app")
It allows you to sync your RSS and Atom feeds with an iOS device.

Works pretty well with [ownCloud News](http://apps.owncloud.com/content/show.php/News?content=158434 "News") app as well.

This app is meant to be a continuation of the work on the Owncloud [news-iOS-App](https://github.com/owncloud/news-iOS-App) on a newer platform.
Currently the app is functional but considered an early beta.

## Bugs
- The badges that are supposed to indicate unread messages don't always update.
- Each content update syncs all content instead of only taking the new content.
- Text size can't be changes.
- Sorting can't be changed.
- Probably a lot more
